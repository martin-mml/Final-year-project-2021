Larder management system

Project Vision
For anyone that cooks and shops
Who find it difficult to remember to discard out of date food and what they need to buy at the supermarket to restock what has been used up.
The Larder management system Is a food and consumables  lifecycle management system 
That keeps track of use by and best before dates for you and notifies you when something needs to be removed from the fridge and cupboards. Which can also  suggest meals that can be made when you are lacking that inspiration in the kitchen based on the food available in the house.
